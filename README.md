HumanDiseaseDiagnosis


A project to detect multiple human diseases through symptom analysis using 3 Machine Learning models(SVM,Gaussian NB and Random Forest) 
After running the 3 models the system gives the output as the mode of the other 3. Allowing us to achieve lesser loss and giving us more accurate prediction.
